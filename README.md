## **Spacing**

`BasicSpacingString.py` is simply a shortcut for spacing strings Aâ€“Z.  
Running the script opens **two separate tabs** with the following spacing strings:


`ComplexSpacingString.py` generates every possible combination of uppercase characters together, lowercase characters together, and uppercase with lowercase together.

## **Glyphs**

`EmptyGlyphs.py` opens a new tab with all glyphs that are empty (no paths or components) in the current master.

## **Build Glyphs**

`PasteComponent.py` lets you add a specified component to every current selected glyph in the font. Ideal for creating fallback fonts or when creating new masters.
